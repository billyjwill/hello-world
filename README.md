# hello-world

Hi there!

I've been working hard for a few weeks now to learn all I can. I'm trying to cram a bunch of python, java, javascript and frontend web-development into my brain. At this point in java I feel that I have a practical understanding of the language but I need a ton of practice before I begin to forget the important things. Hopefully by the time anyone reads this I'll have a mountain of decent to outstanding work to show and you're just here to see what kind of energy and optimism I started with.
    Thanks for reading
